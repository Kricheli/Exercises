// Instructions
// Here is your school object (see below):
// Take the school object and create the following methods to
// that object: 
// 1. A method called “findPerson” that takes two arguments, 
// a type (either a student or teacher), and an id.
// It will return a particular object of that person.
// 2. A method called “assignStudent” that takes two 
// arguments, a student’s id and a subject.
// Assign all of the students to the first available teacher who 
// teaches that subject and who is not in full capacity. If all of 
// the teachers are in full capacity log to the console “Sorry, 
// no available teachers left”.
// 3. A method called “assignTeachersSubject” that takes two 
// arguments, the teacher’s id, a new subject.
// Assign the new subject to that particular teacher if that 
// subject doesn’t exist in their array of subjects
// 4. Create a new method of anything you want.
