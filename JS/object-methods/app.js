// 1. Create an object called ‘mycountry’ for a country of your choice, 
// containing properties ‘country’, ‘capital’, ‘language’, ‘population’ 
// and ‘neighbours’ (an array)
// 2. Add a method to the object called 'describe' to the 'myCountry' 
// object. With the help of the ‘this’ keyword, this method will log a 
// string like this to the console:
// ‘Finland has 6 million people, their mother tongue is Finnish, they 
// have 3 neighbouring countries and a capital called Helsinki’. 
// 3. Call the ‘descrbie method’.
// 4. Add a method called 'checkIsland' to the 'myCountry' object. 
// This method will set a new property on the object, called 'isIsland'.
// 'isIsland' will be true if there are no neighbouring countries, and 
// false if there are. Use the ternary operator to set the property.
